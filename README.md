# Windows Updates Uninstaller Utility

This utility (scripted in AutoHotKey) allows you to batch uninstall the Windows Updates you want from your system. It does not uninstall Service Packs, so you need to uninstall those manually.  Works in Windows XP, Vista, 7, and probably 8 (untested at the moment).

## Installation

There's no need to install anything, the executable is portable so you just need to download it and run it. The executable will create a temporal text file in its parent directory while it runs, and it will remove it automatically once it doesn't need it anymore.

You can find the executable in the Releases section.
